    <p>I am an American software Engineer currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics from Northern Arizona University.
    You can checkout my <a href="https://github.com/thetravisweber">github</a>, and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRdUUsRaYSznXr10Nz7HfQ">book review youtube channel</a>. I don't have much to show for myself yet, but I 
    intend on starting a data science company after obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics</p>

      Besides writing coding, doing math, and reading, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, fishing, and offroading.
