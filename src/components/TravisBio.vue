    <p>I am an American software Engineer currently pursuing a degree in
       Mathematics from Northern Arizona University. You can checkout my 
       <a href="https://github.com/thetravisweber">github</a>. I don't have much
        to show for myself yet, but I intend on starting a data science company 
        after obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics.

    <p>
      Besides writing coding, doing math, and reading, I enjoy hiking, mountain 
      biking, fishing, and offroading. I currently live in Flagstaff, AZ, which 
      I highly recommend to outdoorsy people.
