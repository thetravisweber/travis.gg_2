    <p>I am an American software Engineer currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics from Northern Arizona University.
    You can checkout my github, and my book review youtube channel. I don't have much to show for myself yet, but I 
    intend on starting a data science company after obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics</p>
    <p>
      Besides writing coding, doing math, and reading, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, fishing, and offroading.
      I currently live in Flagstaff, AZ, which I highly recommend to outdoorsy people.
