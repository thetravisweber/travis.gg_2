# Travis.gg v2

Second Version of my personal website, found at http://www.travis.gg/.

Shoutout to Evan You, this website is heavily inspired by (read: pretty much coppied from) his personal page,
<https://evanyou.me/>. I intend on changing things up very soon, but I started with his site
as a template on which to build.
